        <h1>1) Round-Robin Scheduling</h1>
        <p>Round robin is the oldest, simplest scheduling algorithm. The name of this algorithm comes from the
            round-robin principle, where each person gets an equal share of something in turn. It is mostly used for
            scheduling algorithms in multitasking. This algorithm method helps for starvation free execution of
            processes.It is pre-emptive algorithm
            The CPU is shifted to next process after fixed interval of time called time quantum.
            The process that is preempted is added to the end of the queue.<br><br></p>


        <h4>
            <li>Advantages</li>
        </h4>
        <p>1. Every process gets an equal share of the CPU.<br><br>
            2. RR is cyclic in nature, so there is no starvation.</p>

        <h4>
            <li>Disadvantages</li>
        </h4>
        <p>1. Setting the quantum too short, increases the overhead and lowers the CPU efficiency, but setting it too
            long may cause poor response to short processes.<br><br>
            2. Average waiting time under the RR policy is often long.<br>
