        <h1>3) Shortest Remaining Time First</h1>
        <p>The full form of SRT is Shortest remaining time. It is also known as SJF preemptive scheduling. In this
            method, the process will be allocated to the task, which is closest to its completion. This method prevents
            a newer ready state process from holding the completion of an older process.<br></p>

        <h4>
            <li>Advantages</li>
        </h4>
        <p>1. The main advantage of the SRTF algorithm is that it makes the processing of the jobs faster than the SJF
            algorithm, mentioned itâ€™s overhead charges are not counted.</p>

        <h4>
            <li>Disadvantages</li>
        </h4>
        <p>1. In SRTF, the context switching is done a lot more times than in SJN due to more consumption of the CPU's
            valuable time for processing. The consumed time of CPU then adds up to its processing time and which then
            diminishes the advantage of fast processing of this algorithm.<br></p>
